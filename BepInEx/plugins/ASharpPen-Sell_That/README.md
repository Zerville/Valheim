## Trader Wares  

'sell_that.selling.cfg'

Trader items are configured by creating a section as follows:

``` INI
[<Some-Unique-Section-Name>]
ItemName = <ItemPrefabName>
Order = <int> //Tries to insert based in traders list based on this. If -1 (or other negative number), it will be added somewhere at the end.
Price = <int> //Price of the item
StackSize = <int> //Number of items to get pr buy
Enabled = <bool> //Can be disabled without deletion.
```

The file comes pre-defined with all existing trader wares.

Multiple entries of the same item can be done by simply choosing a different section name

## Example

``` INI
[Iron Scrap One]
ItemName = IronScrap
Order = 0
Price = 100
StackSize = 1
Enabled = true

[Iron Scrap Two]
ItemName = IronScrap
Order = 1
Price = 500
StackSize = 5
Enabled = true

```

## Trader Buying

'sell_that.buying.cfg'

Trader will buy items that are configured by creating a section as follows:

``` INI
[<Some-Unique-Section-Name>]
ItemName = <ItemPrefabName>
Value = <int>

```

## Example

``` INI

ItemName = Stone
Price = 20

[Stone Selling]

Price = 10
```
